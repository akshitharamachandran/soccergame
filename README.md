# Soccer Game

Soccer Game is a game displayed on a website where a user can play against a neural network AI.

## The Neural Network

A neural network is created in python to breed both the "attacker" and "defender" conponents of the AI. The highest performing attacker after 100 generations of evolution is used in the for that position and same goes for the defender after 50 generations. 

## The Website

The "game" is displayed on a one-page website. The rules, game, and documentation are all on the website and can be accessed by scrolling down the webpage. The primary webpage is "index.html" and all other auxiliary files are in the git repository. 

## Linking the Website and Neural Net
The "best weights" generated by the neural network are then passed into the test.js file. After each move, the position of the AI relative to the soccer ball and goal is then passed into the neural net and using the desired weights its next move is then calculated.

## Downloading

The entire program (including the python script) is available in the [github repository](https://github.com/akshitharamachandran/soccergame). 

## Website Template

The website is based off of a [Start Bootstrap template](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/).
